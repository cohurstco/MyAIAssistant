## Project Overview

This multi-application project combines various technologies and tools to create a comprehensive software solution. It includes MyToDoApp (a MERN stack note-taking application), a Python-based sitemap crawler, and various DevOps and AI components.

### Purpose

The project aims to demonstrate the integration of different technologies and provide a scalable, maintainable, and efficient software ecosystem.

### Key Features

- MyToDoApp: A MERN stack note-taking application for creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes
- Python-based sitemap crawler
- AI integration for enhanced functionality (e.g., natural language processing for notes, intelligent sitemap analysis)
- Comprehensive DevOps setup with CI/CD pipeline
- Serverless architecture using AWS Lambda

### Technology Stacks

- MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) for MyToDoApp
- Python (Flask, FastAPI) for Sitemap Crawler
- AI/ML tools and libraries (e.g., TensorFlow, scikit-learn)
- DevOps tools (Docker, Terraform)
- Serverless (AWS Lambda)

### High-level Architecture

The project follows a microservices architecture, with each application functioning independently while sharing common infrastructure and DevOps practices. MyToDoApp handles note-taking functionality, while the Python-based sitemap crawler provides web crawling capabilities. AI components are integrated to enhance various features across the applications, such as intelligent note categorization and advanced sitemap analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (for MyToDoApp)
- Python 3.x (for Sitemap Crawler)
- MongoDB
- Docker
- AWS CLI
- Terraform

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multi-application-project.git
   cd multi-application-project
   ```

2. Install dependencies for each application:
   ```
   # For MyToDoApp (MERN stack application)
   cd MyToDoApp
   npm install
   cd frontend && npm install
   cd ../backend && npm install

   # For the Sitemap Crawler
   cd ../../SitemapCrawler
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Set up environment variables:
   Create a `.env` file in each application directory and add the necessary environment variables.

### Configuration

1. For MyToDoApp:
   - Configure MongoDB connection string in the `backend/.env` file:
     ```
     ATLAS_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
     PORT=5000
     ```
2. Set up AWS credentials for serverless deployments.
3. Configure AI services as needed.

## Usage

### MyToDoApp (MERN Stack Note-Taking App)

1. Start the backend server:
   ```
   cd MyToDoApp/backend
   npm start
   ```
2. In a new terminal, start the frontend development server:
   ```
   cd MyToDoApp/frontend
   npm start
   ```
3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

### Sitemap Crawler

1. Run the application:
   ```
   cd SitemapCrawler
   python main.py
   ```
2. Access the web interface at `http://localhost:8000`

For more detailed usage instructions, refer to the application-specific README files.

## Testing

We maintain a comprehensive test suite to ensure code quality and prevent regressions. To run the tests:

1. For MyToDoApp:
   ```
   cd MyToDoApp
   npm test
   ```

2. For the Sitemap Crawler:
   ```
   cd SitemapCrawler
   python -m pytest
   ```

Please ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions to this project! Please follow these steps to contribute:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
