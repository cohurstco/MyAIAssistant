## Project Structure

The project is divided into two main parts:

- `frontend/`: Contains the React application
- `backend/`: Contains the Express server and API

Each directory has its own README with more specific information.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js (latest LTS version)
- npm (comes with Node.js)
- MongoDB Atlas account or a local MongoDB installation
- Git

## Installation

To install MyToDoApp, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```BASH
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/MyToDoApp.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```BASH
   cd MyToDoApp
   ```

3. Install the dependencies for both frontend and backend:

   ```BASH
   cd frontend && npm install
   cd ../backend && npm install
   ```

## Configuration

1. In the `backend/` directory, create a `.env` file with the following content:

   ```BASH
   ATLAS_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   PORT=5000
   ```

   Replace `your_mongodb_connection_string` with your actual MongoDB connection string.

2. If you need to change the backend URL in the frontend, you can do so in the API service files located in the `frontend/src/services/` directory.

## Usage

To run the application:

1. Start the backend server:

   ```BASH
   cd backend && npm start
   ```

2. In a new terminal, start the frontend development server:

   ```BASH
   cd frontend && npm start
   ```

3. Open your web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## API Endpoints

The backend provides the following API endpoints:

- `GET /api/notes/`: Fetch all notes
- `POST /api/notes/`: Create a new note
- `GET /api/notes/:id`: Fetch a specific note by ID
- `PUT /api/notes/:id`: Update a specific note by ID
- `DELETE /api/notes/:id`: Delete a specific note by ID

For more details, refer to the backend README.
