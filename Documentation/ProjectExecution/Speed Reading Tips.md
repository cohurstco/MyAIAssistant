# Speed Reading Tips

## Pre-reading Techniques

- Define Purpose: Since purpose has such power, set a goal or purpose anytime you sit down to read. Determine beforehand what you want or hope to gain from the material.[1]
- Is it to get lost and relax, to learn something?
- When you pick up something to read, state your purpose or intention. The more precise the purpose, the easier it will be for the mind to grasp the information—and the faster you can sift through it.
  - Question the purpose to clarify why you are reading it, what you want from it, or how it will be helpful.[2]
  Preview: This is how I want you to approach reading: to preview the material before reading it. That means scrolling through the text, scanning the table of contents, significant headings, any words in bold or italics, visual aids, and relevant information. [3]
  - Previewing is one of the most valuable steps for improving reading speed and comprehension.
  - Title; Heading; Introduction; Every word in bold, underline, quote, and italics; Visual Aids, End of Chapter Questions, Summary/Conclusion (T.H.I.E.V.E.S)
  Change Reading Style: Each type of material presents its challenges. Be aware of the challenges and change your speed accordingly. [4]
  - Technical, Familiar, Pleasure, Relevance, Foundational, Pace

Speed Reading Techniques

- Space Reading: paying attention to the white space between 2-4 words. This prevents the eyes from narrowing their focus and, thus, fixating on individual words. As a result, the eyes can pick up more information, just as when they look at someone’s face as a whole instead of the individual parts.
  - When doing this, don’t analyze, evaluate, or verbalize the words aloud or in your head. Maintain a steady rhythm and skim from left to right across each sentence, from one blank space to the next, without stopping or trying to ensure you understand what is being said. [1]
- Chunking: involves looking at the words themselves. However, instead of looking at words one at a time, you glance at groups, or chunks, of words. [2]
  - When we look at a word, the eyes’ natural tendency is to narrow their field of vision to that specific word while disregarding the words around it. That leaves us no choice but to read text one word at a time. Chunking opens our line of sight to capture more words in a single glance. The eyes are not set on a single word of a sentence but instead on a block or “chunk” of words in that sentence. You look at a chunk, move to another chunk, then another, and so on.
- Sub-vocalization: The act of pronouncing every word you read. When subvocalizing, you either say words out loud, hear them spoken in your mind, or move your lips to their pronunciation.
  - Information is received faster from sight than from hearing or speaking. Relying on sight alone instantly increases speed because you go from glancing at words to directly understanding their meaning without any intermediate steps in between. As stated, simply silencing the inner narrator can double or triple reading speed right here and right now.
  - Close your mouth, Read Faster than speech,  Hum, or use Music to help with stopping sub-vocalization

Enhancing the Techniques

  Reduce Number of Fixations: The obvious way to reduce fixation is to pick up more words each time the eye stops. You learned to do this in the last section through Space Reading,    chunking, and limiting sub-vocalization. These techniques were designed for this exact purpose. [1]
  Reduce Length of Fixations: Another tactic is to shorten the time the eyes spend on each fixation. Instead of pausing for an extended period, continue moving the eyes forward when reading. Don’t slow down to contemplate the text—keep moving to the next space or chunk of words.
  Regression: the act of reading the exact text multiple times. It slows reading speed and reduces comprehension because you need to gain the context of what you will read next. It, more importantly, breaks the flow of your reading. [2]

- Natural to regress due to eye movement.
  - Fix: Practice being deliberate with your eye movement and not be erratic. Feel free to read ahead—comprehension over speed.
- Lack of focus due to reading without a purpose.
  - Fix: Have a clear purpose.
- Sub-vocalization is when our eyes race ahead of our mouths.
  - Fix: Practice not verbalizing or visualizing speaking the words.
- The most common reasons are Wrong Fixation or losing your spot.
  - Fix: Use an index card or ruler to focus on the current line.
- Has become a lousy Habit.
  - Fix: Practice the above fixes. Fight the urge to want to regress and tell your brain it is okay to keep moving forward.
  Visual Range: The ability to see objects beyond your direct line of sight. When looking at an object in front of you, it's easy to see because your eyes are directly on it—using your peripherals to pick up more words with less eye movement. Your brain processes information from your peripherals 25% faster.
    Exercises to enhance your Visual Range:
    1. Sticks and straw: Insert 2 toothpicks into a straw simultaneously while looking at the center of the straw.
    2. Off the wall: Throw a bouncy ball off of the wall and catch it with alternating hands.
    3. Open your Awareness: Pick a focus point, then try to notice things in your peripheral.
    4. The Shultz Table is a table or grid filled with numbers, letters, or words, usually with 3x3, 4x4, or 5x5 dimensions. The goal of the table is to focus on the text in the center square while using peripheral vision to identify as many numbers and letters as possible in the outer squares. [3]
    5. Raining Letters: a table with three columns of letters. Look at the letters in the center column while reciting the letters to the left and right.
    6. Center Text: Using a paragraph with a vertical line drawn down the middle. Aim focus on the vertical line, and with your side vision, notice how many words you can make out to the left and right. Move down the vertical line, picking up the words on both sides until you reach the end of the paragraph.

Improving Comprehension

  Ideas and Main Points: The first step to comprehension is paying attention to the main idea or overarching point the writer is trying to communicate, understanding the main point and the bigger picture, and staying aware of the details. An excellent way to recognize the main points is to identify the levels embedded in any written composition. It begins with understanding the meaning of a sentence, then how that sentence fits into the paragraph, and then how the paragraph supports the more extensive chapter. Finally, how the chapter supports the overall piece. [1]
  Topic Sentences (TS): Identifying the topic sentence will help you understand the idea with a paragraph.
    Structure of a Paragraph.
    - Topic Sentence: The main idea of a paragraph with a summary of the facts or description contained within.
    - Supporting sentences:  Sell the idea the topic sentence makes using details.
    - Concluding sentence: Brings the paragraph to a close by restating the topic sentence or summarizing the information within the supporting sentences.

Characteristics of a TS

- The first sentence of a paragraph.
- It is shorter and more generalized than the other sentences in the paragraph.
- Often poses a question. Turning a topic sentence into a question and seeing if the supporting sentences answer it is an excellent way to find the TS.
- A word or two in the topic sentence usually repeats in the paragraph.
- TS uses transition words (next, another, and, however, although) to smoothly lead readers from one paragraph to the next.
- TS can also be found after a transition sentence.

Previewing Types of Materials

- Articles and Reports: Read the first and last paragraphs, examine words in bold or italics, read quoted texts, and glance at any illustrations.
- Books and Manuals: Read the front and back covers. Review the table of contents to get a feel for the organization, and notice if the book is divided into sections or parts. Read the chapter headings to get a sense of the topics covered. Next, read samples of the text. If there is a preface, begin there. Read also the entire introduction and conclusion. Finally, skim through the book and notice items in bold, italics, quotes, diagrams, or tables. While skimming, read the first and last paragraphs of each chapter.
- Textbooks: The approach to previewing textbooks is similar to books and manuals, though, in all likelihood, you’ll be reading a textbook for a class. Therefore, the reading will be assigned one chapter at a time—or even one subheading. So, instead of previewing the entire textbook, focus only on the designated portion. Begin with the chapter objectives, then read the summaries at the start of each chapter. Most textbooks have review questions at the end of each chapter or section; read them and remember them. As always, examine all items in bold, italics, quotes, illustrations, and graphs.
- Stories & Novels: Students always ask if it is necessary to preview stories or novels. The answer is it depends. If reading a story or novel for pleasure, you may want to avoid any preview; otherwise, you’ll uncover too much of the plot or, worse, the ending. Knowing too much takes away from the joy of reading such material. On the other hand, previewing a story or novel as an assignment for class, especially if you will be tested on your knowledge, is beneficial. In these instances, approach preview like any other material: read the front and back covers. Review the table of contents. Skim through the text. This type of material is unlikely to have items in bold or italics or many illustrations or graphs, so instead, pay attention to the plot, setting, characters, and the roles they play.

Guidelines to Approach Different Types of Readin.

- Technical: Let’s start with technical manuals. Since such materials provide instructions and procedures that must be carefully followed, each line of text becomes extremely important. Overlooking even one or two sentences can result in errors and grave consequences. Therefore, curb any temptation to race over such works haphazardly. Instead, carefully chew and digest every line. The same applies to legal documents, annual reports, write-ups, and policies. These documents are better to read in their entirety and given full attention and focus. Similarly, it’s sensible to slow down if you have to teach the material to someone else. Even a love letter or poem might be worth slowing down to enjoy the prose as the writer intended.
- Familiar: When reading material related to an academic major or profession, there’s less need to be as careful, but careful enough to understand and retain the material thoroughly. This can involve taking notes and stopping regularly to test your knowledge of the subject. The same applies if the text is complicated, filled with big words and fancy grammar, or if the subject is new. On the other hand, if you are well versed on a topic, already familiar with the writer’s other work, or accustomed to the genre, you can increase the pace. Some people are used to reading textbooks; whether computer science or political science, they have no problem learning from such material. Books are stale and boring for others, so they have to change their pace and rhythm to stay engaged.
- Pleasure: With material read for pleasure, you can be relaxed. There is no need to rush, but at the same time, no need to go slow. Read at a pace that feels comfortable and enjoyable at the moment. What feels comfortable will vary depending on your mood. Some days, you’ll feel like reading without worrying about what you learn, how much you take in, or how useful it will prove. On other days, you may find absorbing every sensory detail or dissecting the meaning behind every word more enjoyable. At the same time, there is no need to force yourself to read every sentence; take in what you can and skip areas with little to no interest. Some delight in a leisurely perusal of the morning paper by selecting areas of interest while ignoring content that lacks appeal. If it’s for pleasure, do what is pleasing.
- Relevance: Something else worth considering is how long the information will remain relevant. If reading to find a solution to a problem that, once solved, has no further use, then there is no need to be so meticulous. On the other hand, be thorough if the information is essential to your major or occupation or if it’s indispensable to another area of life, such as health or finances. Also, consider the level of knowledge you seek. Do you seek a quick explanation, broad ideas, complete comprehension, or detailed analysis? The more you desire, the slower and more attentively you should read.
- Foundational: Finally, always spend extra time on information that sets the foundation for other things you will learn. The natural inclination is to skim over the foundational elements because they feel familiar or easy to grasp. However, if you browse over the basics, you will need help with reading and learning what comes later. Certain subjects are, indeed, cumulative! That means paying extra attention to the earlier parts of books, stories, and novels, where the foundational elements are developed. At the same time, please pay attention to earlier parts of courses and training as they establish the groundwork for the more complex ideas to come. Once you have a solid base, you can change pace as desired, which leads to the next point.
- Pace: Some materials require changing their pace frequently. Specific chapters or sections you’ll read quickly. With other chapters, you’ll hit a difficult patch that you sense is important, so you slow down and read carefully. Then, you speed up again. This is particularly true with research. Research requires reading a wide range of materials to support or reject a claim or to find a solution. When conducting research, many ideas will be familiar. Ideas that appear in one source may also appear in several other sources. In these cases, race over the ideas that repeat and slow down for those that are new or foreign.
