TIAGO FORTE
Twelve favorite problems: What are the questions you're working on?
Intermediate packets: concrete, individual building blocks that make up your work, e.g. a set of notes from a meeting, a list of research findings, a slide deck, a blog post.
Archipelago of ideas: collected inspiration and notes that help you to get started on a project.
Hemingway bridges: before ending a work session, write a few notes about next steps on the project, to help you pick it back up. (Bonus: share the work in progress and ask for feedback).
Dial down the scope: test the waters with something small and concrete.
