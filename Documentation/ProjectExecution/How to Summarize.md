# Summarizing Option 1

I would like you to read the text delimited by triple quotes and summarize it using the nine critical reading methods and the following guidelines.

- Capture and summarize the message and purpose the writer is trying to convey, helping shorten and simplify it without losing the context of the overall message and intent of the shared purpose.
- Find and collect topic sentences, relevant highlights, empathized sentences and words, repeated ideas, and counterpoints.
- Please share the information, facts, and opinions in topic sentences, 3- 4 paragraphs, or bullet points based on the amount of information that will be presented to the user.
- Please let the user know if the source is informational or instructional, compares or contrasts things, lists pros and cons, is an opinion piece, calls to action, or any other purpose of the source.
- If instructions or ordered information are presented, use numbered lists to organize the necessary operations and steps of the process.
- Please write out acronyms the first time they are used in a sentence with the abbreviation in brackets after the term.
- List out biases, opinions, and facts
- Add a glossary of critical terms, jargon, and definitions at the end and add markdown footnotes to the first word in the summarization.
- If there are complex topics, please break them down into size data entries that can easily be digested and explained to a 15-year-old

Summarize Option 2

Can you summarize that into an outline of headers, summarized sentences, bullets, or lists about the main topic sentences, highlights or emphasized words and sentences, questions and answers, quotes, Glossary terms, and references from the text?

Summarize Option 2.1

Please use the following topics or keywords to generate an outline that includes titles, headers, chapters, subsections, bullets, or lists about the main topic sentences, highlights or emphasized words and sentences, questions and answers, quotes, glossary terms, acronyms, jargon, and references from the text. Output it in Markdown format. Only give me the output and nothing else. The outline should be in the ${lang} language. Topics or keywords: "${input}"

Summarize Option 3

You are a highly skilled AI trained in language comprehension and summarization. I would like you to use the nine critical reading methods to read the text delimited by triple quotes and output the outputs of each of the nine methods. Aim to retain the most essential points, providing a coherent and readable summary that could help a person understand the main points of the discussion without needing to read the entire text. Please avoid unnecessary details or tangential points.

Only give me the output and nothing else. Do not wrap responses in quotes. Respond in the ${lang} language.

Summarization Option 4

Note: this needs integrate with the rest of the summarization options and them prompted engineered.

For most of my career I have felt overwhelmed by the endless stack of “must-read” business books 📚

Then, something clicked, and last year I read 12 books (I don’t know you, but for me it’s a lot).

Over the last year my approach to books radically changed, in part because of how I started to use summaries 👇

1. 📋 𝗦𝗧𝗔𝗥𝗧 𝗪𝗜𝗧𝗛 𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗦𝗨𝗠𝗠𝗔𝗥𝗬

    Instead of diving straight into a 300-page tome, I begin with a high-quality summary (e.g. on Shortform).

    Here's why:

    ⏱️ 𝗧𝗶𝗺𝗲 𝗲𝗳𝗳𝗶𝗰𝗶𝗲𝗻𝗰𝘆 — a good summary takes ~30 minutes, vs. 4-5 hours for a full book

    🧠 𝗠𝗲𝗻𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝗺𝗼𝗱𝗲𝗹 𝗯𝘂𝗶𝗹𝗱𝗶𝗻𝗴 — it creates a framework for better retention if you read the full book

    🎯 𝗥𝗲𝗹𝗲𝘃𝗮𝗻𝗰𝗲 𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘀𝘀𝗺𝗲𝗻𝘁 — quickly gauge if the book aligns with my current needs

2. 🔍 𝗗𝗘𝗖𝗜𝗗𝗘 — 𝗗𝗜𝗩𝗘 𝗗𝗘𝗘𝗣𝗘𝗥 𝗢𝗥 𝗠𝗢𝗩𝗘 𝗢𝗡?

    After the summary, I am at a decision point. Do I read the full thing?

    For ~60% of the books, I actually stop there. And for many of them, I don’t even finish the summary! For many reasons:

    Maybe they are not that good

    Maybe I know a lot of the topic already

    Maybe I am not *that* interested in the topic

    But the best books leave me intrigued, so I move on to the full thing 👇

3. 📖 𝗥𝗘𝗔𝗗 𝗧𝗛𝗘 𝗙𝗨𝗟𝗟 𝗕𝗢𝗢𝗞 𝗦𝗧𝗥𝗔𝗧𝗘𝗚𝗜𝗖𝗔𝗟𝗟𝗬

    You may be wondering — aren't summaries enough? For the best books, they are not. Here is why:

    🧩 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝘅𝘁 — full books offer rich examples and stories, which summaries miss. Summaries usually get the “frameworks” right but struggle with practical use.

    🔄 𝗘𝘅𝗽𝗼𝘀𝘂𝗿𝗲 — spending 4-5 hours with ideas is different from 30 mins. Extended time helps “install” ideas in your brain, running them in the background, and letting you find… 👇

    🔗 𝗖𝗼𝗻𝗻𝗲𝗰𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻𝘀 — more exposure + more context == easier to link ideas to your own challenges.

    So, my goal isn't to read every book cover-to-cover, but to extract the maximum value for my time investment. So I can afford to engage with more ideas, while deeply exploring those that are the most relevant to me.
