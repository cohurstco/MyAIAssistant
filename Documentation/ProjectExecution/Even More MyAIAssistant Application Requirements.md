# MyAIAssistant Application Requirements

Note-Taking Feature:

- Robust collection feature for multimedia content (images, videos, audio, text, HTML web pages, URL links, Markdown, code blocks)
- Ability to capture or upload media from various sources (devices, apps, browsers)
- Seamless integration with cloud services for storing original media types
- Transformation of media into easily passable JSON and encrypted text at rest
- Database design that maintains data integrity and relationships

Personal Knowledge Management (PKM) System using PARA:

- Project, Area, Resource, Archive (PARA) system for organizing files, images, recordings, documents, and other collected artifacts.
- Tracking of tasks, calendar events, and personal notes to help users stay focused and productive
- Integration with Collect, Organize, Distill, and Express (CODE) system for searching archives and collecting resources.
- The application uses this to organize user notes, tasks, calendar events, and reminders based on current project and goal needs. The application can move resources from archives to the resources section to the areas of interest section and then to the project hierarchy structure based on the need for recall ability and project or goal-related context.

CODE System:

- Collecting archived knowledge, user-inputted, user-shared, and application-integrated resources focused on areas of interest (AOI) for projects.
- We manage PKM by searching archived and new sources and filtering out unneeded information and distractions.
- Assist the note-taking PARA system in collecting, organizing, distilling, and expressing information and data.  

Task Management Feature:

- Task tracking and management
- Calendar event scheduling
- Reminder system
- Prioritization by urgency, impact, importance, and effort

Offline Mode, Caching, and Server-Side Rendering:

- Offline mode for mobile and web performance
- Caching for improved loading times
- Server-side rendering for scalable performance

Highest-to-Lowest-Value Considerations:

1. Best user experience
2. System performance
3. Cost
4. Security
5. Maintainability
6. Scalability

These are the essential requirements we've identified so far.

After analyzing the requirements, I've identified some common themes, additional requirements, requirement conflicts, and redundant requirements. Here's a breakdown:

Common Themes

1. **Collecting**: Gathering resources from various sources (browser clips, audiovisuals, etc.) and converting them to other media formats.
2. **Organizing**: The note-taking app should be able to make notes, use tags, relate ideas together via relationships and associations, consume and create calendar invites, tasks, goals, and emails, and allow users to add metadata tags to notes and artifacts.
3. **Distilling**: The app can take an article and extract the topic sentence, main points, and relationships between concepts.

Additional Requirements

- Digital Workspace**: Allow users to copy, paste, and move items around to create a digital workspace for knowledge management.
- Understanding Bias**: The app should be able to identify bias in text and provide metadata tables to track biases.
- Integration with Google Assistant**: Integrate the note-taking app with Google Assistant for voice commands.

Requirement Conflicts

- Collecting vs. Organizing**: Some requirements overlap, such as collecting resources and organizing notes. Clarification is needed on how these features will interact with each other.
- Distilling vs. Expressing**: The "Distill" requirement focuses on extracting main points from articles, while the "Express" requirement allows users to share their notes on social media platforms. These requirements might be redundant or have different priorities.

Redundant Requirements

- Organize** (2nd requirement): This seems similar to the first "Organize" requirement and can be merged or combined.
- Collecting** (3rd requirement): This is similar to the first two "Collecting" requirements and might not add significant value.

Recommendations

1. Clarify how the "Collecting" and "Organizing" features will interact.
2. Prioritize the "Distilling" feature based on its usefulness in extracting main points from articles.
3. Consider merging or combining redundant requirements to reduce complexity.
4. Evaluate the importance of the "Understanding Bias" feature, as it might be a stretch goal that can be addressed later.
5. Ensure the integration with Google Assistant is well-planned and tested to avoid potential issues.

By addressing these areas, you can refine your note-taking app's requirements and ensure a more focused and effective development process.
