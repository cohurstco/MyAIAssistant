Collecting

- A note-taking app should also be able to take notes from browser clips, audiovisuals, etc., and convert them to other media like audio, video, or text. Based on what the user wants to consume.

- A note-taking app will use your priorities and area of focus to collect resources (sites, articles, news feeds, emails, messengers) for your review.

- A note-taking app will use voice-to-text and text-to-voice.

- A note-taking app should be able to make notes, use tags, and relate to tags to link ideas together via relationships and association.

- A note-taking app should be able to consume and create calendar invites, tasks, goals, and emails. Create a Kanban board or do other views, such as a notebook bullet journal list, numbered list, etc., to help visualize notes from multiple lenses.

Distill

- A note-taking app can read an article, determine the topic sentence, and generate a consumable relationship between concepts and main points.
- Summarizes information
- Use Critical

- A note-taking app should be shared on multiple social media platforms and shared with people to collaborate.

Detailed Feature Requirements for MyAssistant

The AI Assistant will help me with my goals by supporting me in the following ways:

1. They will collect data, organize, summarize, and produce new content via the CODE method

- Note-taking and recording in multiple forms (transcribing, screenshotting, taking a picture, link sharing, forwarding, list making)
  
1. They will organize the information via the Project, Area, Resource, and Archive (PARA) method to keep it relative to my goals, projects, and focus areas

- Cache
- Hot Storage
- Cold Storage
- Always keep information and data, do soft deletes, or move to cold storage of infrequently accessed data.
- Uses User feedback and reinforcement training to help learn only what it needs to know to assist the user.  
- UUIDs and unique database indexes are to be used with vector databases.
- MD5Hash of segment sent data and record comparing.
- Tags and Grouping of all information. Data sharding and metadata tables.
- Links and relationships
- Easily searchable in multiple ways
- My Collection list

1. They will help with time management by using the following:

- goal setting
- prioritizing by The Eisenhower and The Priority Matrix
- planning
- remove distractions

- Information collecting should be based on goals, context, and desired outcomes.

1. They will improve me by helping me learn, generate ideas, create content, track habits and goals, provide feedback and suggestions, and expand my thinking and access to information.

- They will dynamically create new relationships and connections between collected data, notes, ideas, and thoughts to create new content and improve my efficiency and productivity.
- project tracker
- gamification
- challenge my negative thoughts and manage my mental health using CBT and other therapy frameworks to work through them
- Identify biases
- Use multiple sources and look for phrases to identify facts from opinions
- List sources and references
- List alternative ways to achieve the same goal

1. They will integrate with other applications and systems I use daily via APIs to keep me in sync.

- APIs
- GraphQL
- Asynchronous
- Event Message handling,
- Triggered serverless functions for automation actions
- Share everything via QR codes, Hyperlinks, email, blogging, posting on social media, RFC, Bluetooth, WIFI, USB cable, and cloud sharing.

1. They will learn more about me by storing my information, likes, dislikes, preferences, truths, values, beliefs, and knowledge into storage to be used.

- Graph Database
- Dynamo DB
- Mongo DB

1. Protect and secure my data and sharing of my data via

- Use end-to-end encryption,
- Using a privacy-focused provider
- Enforce strong passwords
- Two-factor authentication (2FA)
- Password-protect files
- Sharing time limits
- Monitor file access
- Use a VPN on public WIFI
- Peer-to-peer networks (P2P)

Stretch Goals

- Note-taking apps should have a digital workspace where things can be copied, pasted, and moved around to turn your knowledge garden into producing a product.
- Note-taking apps should be able to understand bias. The app could have a metadata table of biases and use a word bubble/word count of particular words to see if they are biased.
- Note-taking apps will be integrated with Google Assistant and Alexa.
- Use relationship database tables and connect them via indexes, using metadata tables to manage the relationship of indexes, thus increasing the speed of data joining.
