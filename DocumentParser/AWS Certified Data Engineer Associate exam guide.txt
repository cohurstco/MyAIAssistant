Job tasks that are out of scope for the target candidate
The following list contains job tasks that the target candidate is not expected to be 
able to perform. This list is non-exhaustive. These tasks are out of scope for the exam:
• Perform artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) tasks.

Exam content
Response types
There are two types of questions on the exam: 
• Multiple choice: Has one correct response and three incorrect responses 
(distractors)
• Multiple response: Has two or more correct responses out of five or more
response options
Version 1.0 DEA-C01 3 | PAGE
Select one or more responses that best complete the statement or answer the 
question. Distractors, or incorrect answers, are response options that a candidate with 
incomplete knowledge or skill might choose. Distractors are generally plausible 
responses that match the content area.
Unanswered questions are scored as incorrect; there is no penalty for guessing. The
exam includes 50 questions that affect your score.
Unscored content
The exam includes 15 unscored questions that do not affect your score. AWS collects
information about performance on these unscored questions to evaluate these 
questions for future use as scored questions. These unscored questions are not 
identified on the exam.
Exam results
The AWS Certified Data Engineer - Associate (DEA-C01) exam has a pass or fail
designation. The exam is scored against a minimum standard established by AWS 
professionals who follow certification industry best practices and guidelines. 
Your results for the exam are reported as a scaled score of 100–1,000. The minimum 
passing score is 720. Your score shows how you performed on the exam as a whole 
and whether you passed. Scaled scoring models help equate scores across multiple 
exam forms that might have slightly different difficulty levels.
Your score report could contain a table of classifications of your performance at each 
section level. The exam uses a compensatory scoring model, which means that you do 
not need to achieve a passing score in each section. You need to pass only the overall 
exam.
Each section of the exam has a specific weighting, so some sections have more 
questions than other sections have. The table of classifications contains general 
information that highlights your strengths and weaknesses. Use caution when you 
interpret section-level feedback.
